This is a discussion, idea, and note forum for anyone to use to. Please feel free to leave a message.
If you wish to leave me a message the best way to do this is to create a new wiki page. I manage
this wiki myself and I check it as much as I can. Unfortunately this may not be very often for now, as I am a busy engineering student.
To access the wiki click "view on github" at the top right of your screen.

While you're visiting this page also feel free to check out the projects section and make any comments on my project
ideas and plans.
